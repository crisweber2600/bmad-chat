# BMAD - Business Model Architecture Design Platform

An intelligent collaboration ecosystem where AI orchestrates async decision-making between non-technical co-founders (Sarah) and technical co-founders (Marcus).

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**7 Architectural Principles:**
1. **Friction ∝ Stakes** - Small decisions flow fast. Big decisions get ceremony.
2. **Everyone Has a Home** - Sarah: Web UI. Marcus: Git + CLI. Both: Async-first.
3. **AI Amplifies, Humans Decide** - AI proposes, translates, detects. Humans have final say.
4. **Async by Default, Sync by Exception** - Most work async. Sync for alignment + ceremonies.
5. **Momentum is Sacred** - Projects must always be able to move forward.
6. **Transparency > Permission** - Everyone sees everything. Action requires appropriate role.
7. **Every Decision is Traceable** - Who, what, when, when, why - always answerable.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Momentum-First Dashboard** - Shows trajectory, velocity, and next action
- **Intelligent Question Routing** - Technical questions to technical users, business to business
- **Commitment Hierarchy** - Engineers commit last on validated requirements
- **Role-Based Translation** - AI adapts content for business or technical context
- **Git-Based Requirements** - `.bmad/` directory structure as living specification
- **Real-Time Collaboration** - Presence awareness, typing indicators, activity feed
- **Integrated PR Workflow** - Complete review process within the app
